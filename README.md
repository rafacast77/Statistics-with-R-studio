# Statistics with R Studio   :bar_chart:
The project required the analysis of two datasets, the first one regarding the running of security software to identify known threats. The goal was to find out which software was more efficient based on specific attributes. The distribution of the attributes was analysed using bar charts, scatterplots, boxplots to find interesting information about these attributes.
 
The second dataset contains the length of passwords before and after training staff regarding "Password Security". The goal was to find out if there was enough evidence to conclude that the passwords were longer and more secured after the training. Parametric, non-parametric 
and Tukey's ANOVA tests were used to test for differences.
 
The documents containing the coursework details, graphs and tests with their corresponding explanation can be found in the git-hub repository.
